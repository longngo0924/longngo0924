## 👋 About Me

I’m a **Software Engineer** with a strong focus on **FastAPI**, **Next.js**, **RAG/LLM** and **Cloud Platform** — helping companies build reliable, scalable, and maintainable digital products.

With 5+ years of hands-on experience, I work with startups, product teams, and outsourcing partners to:

- ✅ Integrate RAG/LLM to unlock advanced automation use cases
- ✅ Build backend APIs that scale and are easy to extend  
- ✅ Develop clean, responsive frontends with modern UI/UX  
- ✅ Set up DevOps pipelines (CI/CD) and cloud infrastructure for smooth deployment  
- ✅ Communicate clearly, deliver on time, and adapt quickly to your team's workflow  

Whether you’re looking to extend your in-house team, build an MVP fast, or need a senior dev who can own an entire feature — I’m ready to help you ship with confidence.

💡 _Let’s build something solid together._
